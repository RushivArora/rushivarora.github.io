### Skydiving with Dad, Niagara circa 2022

<br>

Dad and I have wanted to skydive for an eternity. After a beautiful rocky tour starting in Vancouver and ending in Banff, we ended the 2022 Canada journey with a skydive. I even got to pull the parachute.

> Dad said he's going back again when he's 75 - the love for adrenaline must run in the family.

### Advanced Scuba Certification, Key Largo 2019

<br>

> Went on a night dive for 50 mins. Kept out flashlights off for at least 35 minutes. Turned them on to a nurse shark 3 feet from me.

### On the Agenda (growing list)
* Skydive Certification - planned for summer 2023
* Deep Scuba Specialisation - already have the advanced certification. No timeline
* HALO Jumping - if I can afford it
