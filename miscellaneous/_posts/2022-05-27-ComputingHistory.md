### Finding Claude Shannon's old textbook

<br>

Professor Baird Soules went to the garage sale of (I believe) Claude Shannon's grandchild and got these old textbooks for cheap. I didn't know this, but he was a MIT professor and lived in MA till he died.

<br>

I still can't believe that I got to touch and peruse the textbook that the Father of Information Theory studied from, and that I got to his penned corner notes - WOW! Too bad I couldn't strike a deal with Professor Soules to sell it to me.

> A lot more signals in that textbook. It does make sense since everything was analog then.

### Finding a functional Apple II signed by Steve Wozniak!

Found this technological marvel fully functional at M5. Notice the signature by the dash.
