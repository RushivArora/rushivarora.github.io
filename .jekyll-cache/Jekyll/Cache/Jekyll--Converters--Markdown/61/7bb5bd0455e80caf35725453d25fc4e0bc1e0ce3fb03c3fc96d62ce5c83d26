<h3 id="finding-claude-shannons-old-textbook">Finding Claude Shannon’s old textbook</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Professor Baird Soules went to the garage sale of (I believe) Claude Shannon’s grandchild and got these old textbooks for cheap. I didn’t know this, but he was a MIT professor and lived in MA till he died.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I still can’t believe that I got to touch and peruse the textbook that the Father of Information Theory studied from, and that I got to his penned corner notes - WOW! Too bad I couldn’t strike a deal with Professor Soules to sell it to me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A lot more signals in that textbook. It does make sense since everything was analog then.</p>

<p>Found this technological marvel fully functional at M5. Notice the signature by the dash.</p>

  <p>Of course, I programmed it to say ‘Hello World!’.</p>
